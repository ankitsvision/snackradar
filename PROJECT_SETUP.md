# SnackRadar Project Setup Summary

This document provides an overview of the initial project setup completed for the SnackRadar iOS application.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Structure (MVVM)

Created a clean MVVM-friendly folder structure:

```
SnackRadar/
├── App/                    Application entry point and global state
│   ├── SnackRadarApp.swift    Main app with Firebase initialization
│   ├── AppState.swift          Global app state (loading, errors)
│   └── AppSession.swift        Authentication session management
├── Models/                 Data models (ready for expansion)
├── ViewModels/            View models for business logic
├── Views/                 SwiftUI views
│   └── RootView.swift         Root navigation with auth routing
├── Services/              Business logic and API services
│   └── FirebaseService.swift  Firebase service singleton
├── Resources/             Assets and design system
│   ├── Assets.xcassets/       Asset catalog with color sets
│   ├── Colors.swift           Color palette utilities
│   └── Fonts.swift            Font utilities with fallbacks
└── Environment/           Configuration files
    ├── README.md              Firebase setup instructions
    └── GoogleService-Info-Template.plist
```

### 2. Xcode Project Configuration

- **Target**: iOS 15.0+
- **Bundle Identifier**: com.snackradar.app
- **Product Name**: SnackRadar
- **Signing**: Manual (ready for team configuration)

#### Capabilities Configured:
- ✅ Sign in with Apple
- ✅ Push Notifications  
- ✅ Background Modes (Remote notifications)

### 3. Firebase Integration

#### Swift Package Dependencies Added:
- Firebase Auth (10.0.0+)
- Firebase Firestore (10.0.0+)
- Firebase Storage (10.0.0+)
- Firebase Messaging (10.0.0+)

#### Service Setup:
- `FirebaseService.shared` singleton for centralized Firebase access
- Firebase initialized in app entry point
- Firestore persistence enabled
- Messaging configuration ready

#### Configuration:
- Environment/README.md with detailed setup instructions
- GoogleService-Info-Template.plist as reference
- Actual GoogleService-Info.plist excluded from git

### 4. Design System

#### Color Palette:
| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Primary Blue | #4A90E2 | Main brand color, primary actions |
| Secondary Yellow | #F5A623 | Accents and highlights |
| Light Grey | #FAFAFA | Background color |

Colors are available as:
- Swift code: `AppColors.primaryBlue`
- Asset catalog: Named color sets for interface builder

#### Typography:
- **Recoleta**: Display and heading font (with serif fallback)
- **Open Sans**: Body text (with system fallback)
- Utilities in `AppFonts` with automatic fallback logic

### 5. Application Architecture

#### Entry Point (SnackRadarApp.swift):
- Firebase configuration on app launch
- Environment object injection (AppState, AppSession)
- Scene-based lifecycle

#### State Management:
- **AppState**: Global state for loading indicators, errors, notifications
- **AppSession**: Authentication state with Firebase Auth listener
- Both injected as @EnvironmentObject throughout view hierarchy

#### Root Navigation (RootView.swift):
- Automatic routing based on authentication state
- Loading overlay for async operations
- Placeholder views for auth and main experience

### 6. Git Configuration

#### .gitignore:
- Xcode user data and build artifacts
- Swift Package Manager generated files
- Firebase configuration (GoogleService-Info.plist)
- macOS system files

#### Documentation:
- README.md with comprehensive setup instructions
- CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
- LICENSE (MIT)
- Environment/README.md with Firebase setup guide

## 🚀 Next Steps for Developers

### Initial Setup:

1. **Configure Firebase**
   ```bash
   # Follow instructions in SnackRadar/Environment/README.md
   # Download GoogleService-Info.plist from Firebase Console
   # Place in SnackRadar/Environment/ directory
   ```

2. **Open Project**
   ```bash
   open SnackRadar.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Configure Signing**
   - Select your development team in Xcode
   - Update bundle identifier if needed

4. **Run the App**
   - Select target device/simulator
   - Build and run (⌘R)

### Development Workflow:

1. **Models**: Add data structures in `Models/`
   - Conform to `Codable` for Firebase
   - Keep models pure (no business logic)

2. **ViewModels**: Add view models in `ViewModels/`
   - Conform to `ObservableObject`
   - Use `@Published` for state
   - Inject services via initializer

3. **Views**: Add SwiftUI views in `Views/`
   - Use `@EnvironmentObject` for shared state
   - Keep views focused on presentation
   - Extract reusable components

4. **Services**: Add integrations in `Services/`
   - Use `FirebaseService.shared` for Firebase ops
   - Handle errors and update AppState
   - Make services testable

## 📋 File Inventory

### Root Level:
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `Package.swift` - Swift Package Manager manifest
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Development guidelines
- `LICENSE` - MIT license

### SnackRadar/ (Source):
- `Info.plist` - App configuration
- `SnackRadar.entitlements` - Capabilities configuration
- 7 Swift source files (App, Views, Services, Resources)
- Asset catalog with app icon and color sets
- Environment configuration with README

### Xcode Project:
- `SnackRadar.xcodeproj/` - Xcode project file
- Shared scheme configured
- Swift Package Manager integration
- Build configurations (Debug/Release)

## 🔐 Security Notes

- `GoogleService-Info.plist` is gitignored (contains sensitive keys)
- Each developer needs their own Firebase configuration
- Signing certificates not included (configure locally)
- No hardcoded credentials or API keys in source

## 🎨 Design Assets

### Color Assets Created:
- PrimaryBlue.colorset
- SecondaryYellow.colorset  
- LightGrey.colorset

### App Icon:
- Placeholder app icon structure created
- Ready for icon assets (add via Xcode)

### Custom Fonts:
- Font utilities with fallbacks created
- To add custom fonts:
  1. Add font files to project
  2. Register in Info.plist
  3. Fonts.swift will automatically use them

## 🧪 Testing Setup

Ready for:
- Unit tests (ViewModels, Services)
- UI tests (SwiftUI views)
- Firebase integration tests (with mocks)

Add test targets via Xcode when needed.

## 📱 Platform Support

- **Minimum**: iOS 15.0
- **Devices**: iPhone, iPad
- **Orientation**: Portrait, Landscape
- **Dark Mode**: Light mode only (configurable in Info.plist)
